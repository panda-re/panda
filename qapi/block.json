# @BiosAtaTranslation:
#
# Policy that BIOS should use to interpret cylinder/head/sector
# addresses.  Note that Bochs BIOS and SeaBIOS will not actually
# translate logical CHS to physical; instead, they will use logical
# block addressing.
#
# @auto: If cylinder/heads/sizes are passed, choose between none and LBA
#        depending on the size of the disk.  If they are not passed,
#        choose none if QEMU can guess that the disk had 16 or fewer
#        heads, large if QEMU can guess that the disk had 131072 or
#        fewer tracks across all heads (i.e. cylinders*heads<131072),
#        otherwise LBA.
#
# @none: The physical disk geometry is equal to the logical geometry.
#
# @lba: Assume 63 sectors per track and one of 16, 32, 64, 128 or 255
#       heads (if fewer than 255 are enough to cover the whole disk
#       with 1024 cylinders/head).  The number of cylinders/head is
#       then computed based on the number of sectors and heads.
#
# @large: The number of cylinders per head is scaled down to 1024
#         by correspondingly scaling up the number of heads.
#
# @rechs: Same as @large, but first convert a 16-head geometry to
#         15-head, by proportionally scaling up the number of
#         cylinders/head.
