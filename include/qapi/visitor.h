/*
 * The QAPI schema defines both a set of C data types, and a QMP wire
 * format.  QAPI objects can contain references to other QAPI objects,
 * resulting in a directed acyclic graph.  QAPI also generates visitor
 * functions to walk these graphs.  This file represents the interface
 * for doing work at each node of a QAPI graph; it can also be used
 * for a virtual walk, where there is no actual QAPI C struct.
 *
 * There are four kinds of visitor classes: input visitors (QObject,
 * string, and QemuOpts) parse an external representation and build
 * the corresponding QAPI graph, output visitors (QObject and string) take
 * a completed QAPI graph and generate an external representation, the
 * dealloc visitor can take a QAPI graph (possibly partially
 * constructed) and recursively free its resources, and the clone
 * visitor performs a deep clone of one QAPI object to another.  While
 * the dealloc and QObject input/output visitors are general, the string,
 * QemuOpts, and clone visitors have some implementation limitations;
 * see the documentation for each visitor for more details on what it
 * supports.  Also, see visitor-impl.h for the callback contracts
 * implemented by each visitor, and docs/qapi-code-gen.txt for more
 * about the QAPI code generator.
 *
 * All of the visitors are created via:
 *
 * Visitor *subtype_visitor_new(parameters...);
 *
 * A visitor should be used for exactly one top-level visit_type_FOO()
 * or virtual walk; if that is successful, the caller can optionally
 * call visit_complete() (for now, useful only for output visits, but
 * safe to call on all visits).  Then, regardless of success or
 * failure, the user should call visit_free() to clean up resources.
 * It is okay to free the visitor without completing the visit, if
 * some other error is detected in the meantime.
 *
 * All QAPI types have a corresponding function with a signature
 * roughly compatible with this:
 *
 * void visit_type_FOO(Visitor *v, const char *name, T obj, Error **errp);
 *
 * where T is FOO for scalar types, and FOO * otherwise.  The scalar
 * visitors are declared here; the remaining visitors are generated in
 * qapi-visit.h.
 *
 * The @name parameter of visit_type_FOO() describes the relation
 * between this QAPI value and its parent container.  When visiting
 * the root of a tree, @name is ignored; when visiting a member of an
 * object, @name is the key associated with the value; and when
 * visiting a member of a list, @name is NULL.
 *
 * The visit_type_FOO() functions expect a non-null @obj argument;
 * they allocate *@obj during input visits, leave it unchanged on
 * output visits, and recursively free any resources during a dealloc
 * visit.  Each function also takes the customary @errp argument (see
 * qapi/error.h for details), for reporting any errors (such as if a
 * member @name is not present, or is present but not the specified
 * type).
 *
 * If an error is detected during visit_type_FOO() with an input
 * visitor, then *@obj will be NULL for pointer types, and left
 * unchanged for scalar types.  Using an output or clone visitor with
 * an incomplete object has undefined behavior (other than a special
 * case for visit_type_str() treating NULL like ""), while the dealloc
 * visitor safely handles incomplete objects.  Since input visitors
 * never produce an incomplete object, such an object is possible only
 * by manual construction.
 *
 * For the QAPI object types (structs, unions, and alternates), there
 * is an additional generated function in qapi-visit.h compatible
 * with:
 *
 * void visit_type_FOO_members(Visitor *v, FOO *obj, Error **errp);
 *
 * for visiting the members of a type without also allocating the QAPI
 * struct.
 *
 * Additionally, in qapi-types.h, all QAPI pointer types (structs,
 * unions, alternates, and lists) have a generated function compatible
 * with:
 *
 * void qapi_free_FOO(FOO *obj);
 *
 * where behaves like free() in that @obj may be NULL.  Such objects
 * may also be used with the following macro, provided alongside the
 * clone visitor:
 *
 * Type *QAPI_CLONE(Type, src);
 *
 * in order to perform a deep clone of @src.  Because of the generated
 * qapi_free functions and the QAPI_CLONE() macro, the clone and
 * dealloc visitor should not be used directly outside of QAPI code.
 *
 * QAPI types can also inherit from a base class; when this happens, a
 * function is generated for easily going from the derived type to the
 * base type:
 *
 * BASE *qapi_CHILD_base(CHILD *obj);
 *
 * For a real QAPI struct, typical input usage involves:
 *
 * <example>
 *  Foo *f;
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  Visitor *v;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(...);
 *  visit_type_Foo(v, NULL, &f, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      ...handle error...
 *  } else {
 *      ...use f...
 *  }
 *  visit_free(v);
 *  qapi_free_Foo(f);
 * </example>
 *
 * For a list, it is:
 * <example>
 *  FooList *l;
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  Visitor *v;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(...);
 *  visit_type_FooList(v, NULL, &l, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      ...handle error...
 *  } else {
 *      for ( ; l; l = l->next) {
 *          ...use l->value...
 *      }
 *  }
 *  visit_free(v);
 *  qapi_free_FooList(l);
 * </example>
 *
 * Similarly, typical output usage is:
 *
 * <example>
 *  Foo *f = ...obtain populated object...
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  Visitor *v;
 *  Type *result;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(..., &result);
 *  visit_type_Foo(v, NULL, &f, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      ...handle error...
 *  } else {
 *      visit_complete(v, &result);
 *      ...use result...
 *  }
 *  visit_free(v);
 * </example>
 *
 * When visiting a real QAPI struct, this file provides several
 * helpers that rely on in-tree information to control the walk:
 * visit_optional() for the 'has_member' field associated with
 * optional 'member' in the C struct; and visit_next_list() for
 * advancing through a FooList linked list.  Similarly, the
 * visit_is_input() helper makes it possible to write code that is
 * visitor-agnostic everywhere except for cleanup.  Only the generated
 * visit_type functions need to use these helpers.
 *
 * It is also possible to use the visitors to do a virtual walk, where
 * no actual QAPI struct is present.  In this situation, decisions
 * about what needs to be walked are made by the calling code, and
 * structured visits are split between pairs of start and end methods
 * (where the end method must be called if the start function
 * succeeded, even if an intermediate visit encounters an error).
 * Thus, a virtual walk corresponding to '{ "list": [1, 2] }' looks
 * like:
 *
 * <example>
 *  Visitor *v;
 *  Error *err = NULL;
 *  int value;
 *
 *  v = FOO_visitor_new(...);
 *  visit_start_struct(v, NULL, NULL, 0, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      goto out;
 *  }
 *  visit_start_list(v, "list", NULL, 0, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      goto outobj;
 *  }
 *  value = 1;
 *  visit_type_int(v, NULL, &value, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      goto outlist;
 *  }
 *  value = 2;
 *  visit_type_int(v, NULL, &value, &err);
 *  if (err) {
 *      goto outlist;
 *  }
 * outlist:
 *  visit_end_list(v, NULL);
 *  if (!err) {
 *      visit_check_struct(v, &err);
 *  }
 * outobj:
 *  visit_end_struct(v, NULL);
 * out:
 *  error_propagate(errp, err);
 *  visit_free(v);
 * </example>
