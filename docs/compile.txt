In order to build PANDA, we have a build.sh script in the QEMU directory with
some default options, but first, the prerequisites need to be taken care of.  We
recommend building LLVM and QEMU with the same compiler.  In order to build some
of the PANDA plugins inside of the QEMU directory, a compiler that supports
C++11 is required.

PANDA is known to build on debian 7 linux with the following steps.

1. Install some prereqs.

apt-get install build-essential 
apt-get build-dep qemu
apt-get install nasm
apt-get install libssl-dev

2. Download LLVM 3.3.  Also, download Clang 3.3 and extract it in the LLVM tools
directory.  Compile - If building a debug build, use the following command
(note: the debug build is REALLY slow):

CC=gcc-4.7 CXX=g++-4.7 ./configure --disable-optimized --enable-assertions --enable-debug-symbols --enable-debug-runtime --enable-targets=x86 && REQUIRES_RTTI=1 make -j $(nproc)

If building a release build, use the following command:

CC=gcc-4.7 CXX=g++-4.7 ./configure --enable-optimized --disable-assertions --enable-targets=x86 && REQUIRES_RTTI=1 make -j $(nproc)

3. Compile & install distorm

Get distorm via SVN:
  svn checkout http://distorm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ distorm-read-only

$ cd make/linux
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd ../../include
$ sudo cp * /usr/local/include

3. Compile the QEMU part.  Note that if you want to use LLVM, you may need to
specify the location where your LLVM build is located at the '--with-llvm'
option in qemu/build.sh.

Note: Set the with-lvm to the Release folder of the llvm-3.3

cd panda/qemu
./configure
sh ./build.sh
