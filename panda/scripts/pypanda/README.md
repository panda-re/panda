PYPANDA
========
What is PYPANDA
-
PYPANDA is a modification of PANDA that allows for PANDA plugins to be written in Python.

Instillation
-
Below are the directions to install PYPANDA. These are similar to PANDA.
```
git clone https://github.com/lacraig2/panda.git
cd panda
git checkout pypanda
git submodule update --init dtc
mkdir build
cd build
../build.sh
```

Required Libraries
- cffi
- colorama

### Importing pypanda
```
from pypanda import *
``` 
Currently your script should be in the same folder as the pypanda.py file.


### Set up a Panda instance

```
panda = Panda(arch="i386", mem="128M", os_version="debian:3.2.0-4-686-pae", qcow="/file/path/here", extra_args="") 
```
- arch - string for an architecture
- mem - memory for system
- os_version - string to be passed as "-os"
- qcow - path for qcow for system
- extra_args - any arguments you would like to be passed to QEMU


### Writing a Python Plugin

#### Writing an init function
```
@panda.callback.init
def init(handle):
	progress("init in python. handle="+str(handle))
	panda.register_callback(handle, panda.callback.before_block_exec, before_block_execute)
	return True
```
- @panda.callback.init - Init functions must contain this decorator. This lets cffi know how to use it as a callback. 
- handle - This is a unique identifier. Pass it to register_callback and mostly leave it alone.
- panda.register_callback(...) - next section
- This function must return True or False (or you will run into issues)

#### Registering Callbacks
```
panda.register_callback(handle, callback_type, your_callback_method)
```
- handle - This is a unique identifier for your plugin as an integer.
- callback_type - This is the callback you would like to bind to.
- your_callback_method - This is the method you would like called.

Example:
```
panda.register_callback(handle, panda.callback.before_block_exec, before_block_execute)
```
All callbacks are enumerated in the panda.callback structure. To specify a callback use any member shown in the Valid Callback Locations section.
Example:
```
callback = panda.callback.virt_mem_before_write
```
 ### Writing Callbacks
```
@panda.callback.name_of_callback
def your_callback_name(arg1,arg2,arg3):
    return variable_of_return_type
```

- Your callback must include a decorator. This lets cffi know how to call your callback.
- Your callback must take the number of variables your decorator specifies.
- Your callback must return the same type as your decorator describes


Example:

```
@panda.callback.before_block_exec
def before_block_execute(cpustate,transblock):
	progress("before block in python")
	pdb.set_trace()
	return 0
```

#### Running Recordings

```
panda = Panda(...) # as we saw before
panda.replay("/file/path/here")
```

Note: We will update this once we get it to actually work.


#### Starting up PyPanda

```
panda = Panda(...) # as we saw before
panda.run()
```

This starts the system. No arguments.
