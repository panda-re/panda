pypanda: PANDA's Python Interface
========
What is PYPANDA
-
PYPANDA is a python interface to PANDA. With PYPANDA, you can quickly develop plugins
to analyze behavior of a running system, record a system and analyze replays, or do
nearly anything you can do using PANDA's C/C++ APIs.

Autogenerated pypanda documentation is available at [panda-re.github.io/](https://panda-re.github.io/).

### Technical details
See detailed installation, usage and example programs [here](./docs/USAGE.md).

## Examples
The following examples demonstrate how easy PANDA plugin development can be when you use the Python interface.

#### [after_init.py](examples/after_init.py)

This sets up the callback for `after_machine_init`, hits it, and gives the user
a pdb trace.

#### [disable_callbacks.py](examples/disable_callbacks.py)

This example shows registering, enabling, and disabling of callbacks during 
runtime of a program. In particular, it enables `before_block_execute` and
`after_block_execute`. After 2 blocks hit it disables `after_block_execute`. 
After 2 additional blocks hit it enables `after_block_execute` again.
 
#### [multiple_cbs.py](examples/multiple_cbs.py)

This example shows the ability to set up multiple callbacks. The example sets up
`before_block_exec` as well as `after_block_exec`. There is a delay of 1 second 
every time each callback is called. 

#### [network_session_extraction.py](examples/network_session_extraction.py)

This example implements the networks same functionality as the network plugin in
panda. It registers `replay_handle_packet` callback, converts the buffer, and
writes the buffer out to a pcap.

#### [record_then_replay.py](examples/record_then_replay.py)

This example takes a recording, then replays it under analysis.

#### [dump_regs.py](examples/dump_regs.py)

This example prints the CPU state of an x86 guest after every basic block.
