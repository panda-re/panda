PyPANDA: PANDA's Python Interface
========
Overview
-
PyPANDA is a Python 3 interface to PANDA. With PyPANDA, you can quickly develop plugins
to analyze behavior of a running system, record a system and analyze replays, or do
nearly anything you can do using PANDA's C/C++ APIs.

Autogenerated pypanda documentation is available at [docs.panda.re](https://docs.panda.re).


## Installing

1) Build the regular C/C++ binaries for PANDA according to the documentation. If using build.sh, run `build.sh --python` to automatically complete the subsequent steps.

2) Install pypanda dependencies with:
```
apt-get install -y genisoimage wget libffi-dev
```
Note CFFI is a build dependency for pypanda and your protobuf version needs to match your system version.

3) Build and install the `pandare` Python package
```
$ cd panda/panda/python/core
$ python setup.py install
```

### Technical details
See detailed installation, usage and example programs [here](./docs/USAGE.md).

Also, given the major protobuf update, you may see this message.
```
TypeError: Descriptors cannot be created directly.
If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).

More information: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/news/2022-05-06#python-updates
```
Using `export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` so far was the easiest work around and the performance was still reasonable.

## Examples
Examples are provided in the [examples directory](./examples/).
