pandare: PANDA's Python Interface - PyPI Release
========
Overview
--
`pandare` is a Python 3 interface to PANDA. With pandare (also called PyPANDA), you can quickly develop plugins
to analyze behavior of a running system, record a system and analyze replays, or do
nearly anything you can do using PANDA's C/C++ APIs.

Autogenerated documentation is available at [docs.panda.re](https://docs.panda.re).

Installation
--
Note the PANDARE package provided on pypi only a binray distribution and will certainly only work on `x86_64` hosts as pre-built PANDA libraries from Ubuntu 18.04 are included.


Prior to using pandare **you must install some dependencies**:
```
apt install libvdeplug-dev libpng16-16 libsdl2-2.0-0
```

Then simply install with `pip3 install pandare`. From there, you'll be able to use PANDA with:


```
from pandare import Panda
panda = Panda(generic='i386')
...
```


This is a beta release
---
* Although PANDA is fairly stable, this interface is new and subject to change significantly prior to version 1.0.

* This package is manually generated and may fall behind the code on GitHub.
