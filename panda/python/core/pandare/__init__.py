"""
The PANDA python interface (sometimes called pypanda) is a python module built for interacting with the PANDA project.
The module enables driving an execution of a virtual machine while also introspecting on its execution using PANDA's callback
and plugin systems.

Most of the commonly used APIs are in `pandare.panda`.

Example plugins are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/panda-re/panda/tree/master/panda/python/examples).
