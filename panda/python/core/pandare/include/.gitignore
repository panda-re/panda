# Do not commit the autogenerated files that are placed in this directory!
# If you didn't have to explicitly generate a file and put it here, then
# you shouldn't add it to the repo
*

# A few manually-created files are allowed here:
! panda_datatypes_*.h
! breakpoints.h
! libc_includes.h

# Semi-manually created (a script generates these but it is rarely run and not part of normal development)
! panda_datatypes_*.h

# Also keep .gitattributes so the github UI collapes the panda_datatypes_*.h files
! .gitattributes
