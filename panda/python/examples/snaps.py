# snaps.py
#
# A simple demo script of precise control over taking and restoring
# snapshots with pypanda.  Makes use of prior knowledge of what code
# will be executed when we revert to the 'root' snapshot in the
# indicated qcow.
#
# 1. A after machine init callback lets us start that guest and
# immediate revert it to the snapshot 'root' which is a booted machine
# logged in to the root account.
#
# 2. A before block exec callback lets us wait until we encounter a very
# particular pc (0xc101dfec) which we only knew about bc we ran qemu -d
# in_asm before.  At this pc we take a snapshot.  This callback actually
# contains a little state machine.  After we have taken the snapshot, we
# are in state 3, where we increment a counter with each call, i.e. for
# each new basic block we execute.  After 10 blocks, we revert to the
# snapshot at 0xc101dfec.
#
# Obviously there are more interesting uses for this kind of thing.  Two
# important things to notice.  First, we can take a snapshot that will
# in fact revert to a specific block's start pc.  Second, when we
# revert, we don't keep executing any code.  We snap back to exactly
# that bloc.
