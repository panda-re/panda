# Python Tests
These tests exercise the python interface to PANDA. Every test should exit 0 on success.

The tests will be run as part of CI by the script update.sh in the panda/docker directory.


## Notable files:

*Makefile*: Running `make` should build any binaries used for the tests (not PANDA, just target programs to be copied into guests for testing)

*enabled_tests.txt*: tests to run, one filename (and arguments) per line
