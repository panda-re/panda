'''
1) Start guest and identify kernel symbol->address mappings. End execution
2) Restart guest with two kernel functions hooked.
3) Once both hooks are triggered, end analysis

Both kernel functions should run in the guest and (therefore) both hook functions should be called

This test currently is failing 1/2 the time, probably due to some bug in the hooks plugin?
