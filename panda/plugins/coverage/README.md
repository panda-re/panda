Plugin: coverage
===========

Summary
-------
The `coverage` plugin is used to collect coverage from a live system or replay.
Coverage records are written to a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file to ease
processing by external tools, such as IDA Pro.

The `coverage` plugin provides three different modes of operation. The
`osi-block` mode (which requires Operating System Introspection (OSI) support
for the guest) stores the process name, process ID and thread ID of the thread
executing the block. The `asid-block` mode stores the ASID in which the block
was executed. Whether or not the process was in kernel mode at the time of
execution is also stored, regardless of mode.  (A value of 1 means the block
was executed in kernel mode.) For the `osi-block` and `asid-block` modes, the
mode used to create the CSV file is also written at the top of the file, to cue
parsers in as to how to interpret the file. `edge` mode writes two blocks per
records where the first block represents the "from" node in a control flow
graph (CFG) and the second represents the "to" node. Note that the `edge` mode
requires OSI and only works with X86 guests.

The default behavior is to store a record only the first time it is
encountered. However, the `full` option can be used to store a record every
time a particular record is generated.

When using the `coverage` plugin with a live guest system, it is also possible
to enable and disable the instrumentation using monitor commands.  If desired,
the plugin can be loaded as normal using PANDA command line arguments, and
(optionally) the `start_disabled=true` argument added to tell the system not
to start collecting any data yet. (The `filename` argument is ignored in this
case.) It is also possible to wait until the guest is up to load the `coverage`
plugin, using the standard `load_plugin` command. Regardless of how the plugin
was loaded, the standard `plugin_cmd` monitor command can then be used to send
the `coverage_enable` command to the plugin to start the data collection, or
`coverage_disable` can be used to stop data collection. If no file name is
provided with the `coverage_enable` monitor command, then the default,
`coverage.csv` is used.

The records generated can be filtered using several different options. Using
the filter options can also improve performance because the options are used
to determine whether or not a block should be instrumented. See the arguments
section for a list of filter options.

Regardless of mode used, the output CSV file contains metadata at the top of the header consisting of the PANDA build date and the execution time.  Note that the header is written out each time coverage collection is enabled.

This plugin can be used with the included `coverage.py` script in IDAPython.
`coverage.py` colorizes the dissasembly in IDA Pro using the CSV file produced
by this plugin. It also provides options to add comments to the blocks noting
the sequence of execution, and/or the thread ID (for `osi-block` mode files).
The `coverage.py` script works best when there are no duplicate records, but it
will also work  (more slowly) if the file was produced using the `full` option.
Note that `coverage.py` only works for files produced by the `osi-block` and
`asid-block` modes.

To use the `coverage.py` script, open your target binary in IDA Pro, import the
script in the File -> Script Command window, ensure the Scripting Language is
set to Python, click Run, and when prompted supply the path to the CSV file and
the process or ASID you are analyzing.  You can also turn off the sequence
number or (if applicable) thread ID comments by unchecking the appropriate
check box.

Note, this script assumes IDA has loaded your binary with the correct base
address.  It usually works without manual adjustment for binaries executed in
32-bit Linux or Windows guests.  The base address and/or segment may need to be
adjusted manually for DOS operating systems.

Arguments
---------
* `filename` - The name of the file to output (default:  `coverage.csv`).
* `mode` - Output mode, one of `asid-block`, `osi-block`, or `edge` (default:
`asid-block`). Note that `edge` requires OSI.
* `full` - When `true`, logs each record every time it is generated (default:
`false`)
* `start_disabled` - When `true`, does not start data collection when the
plugin is initialized (default: `false`)
* `process_name` - Filter option, only emit a block if the current process name
matches this argument (requires OSI). Note this filter is done at runtime, not
instrumentation time.
* `pc` - Filter option, only instrument blocks within a given range. Format: 
<Start PC in Hex or Decimal>-<End PC in Hex or Decimal>.
* `privilege` - Filter option, only instrument blocks executed with the
specified privileges. Either: `user` or `kernel`.

Monitor Commands
------------
* `coverage_enable` - Start collecting data to the provided file name.  Uses
`coverage.csv` if no file name is provided.
* `coverage_disable` - Stop collecting data, closing the currently open file.

Dependencies
------------
osi (if `mode` is `osi-block`)

APIs and Callbacks

None

Example
-------
Use the coverage plugin with a recording:
```
panda-system-i386 -m 2G -replay test \
    -os windows-32-xpsp3 \
    -panda coverage:filename=test_coverage.csv,mode=osi-block
```
Use the coverage plugin on a live system:
```
panda-system-i386 -monitor stdio -m 2G -net nic -net user -os linux-32-.+ -panda osi -panda osi_linux:kconf_file=myconf.conf,kconf_group=mygroup -hda myimage.img
