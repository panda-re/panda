Plugin: hooks2
===========

Summary
-------

This plugin provides a mechanism to callback before executing code at a given
range of addresses for a specified program and/or library. Using `osi`, it
resolves program/library mappings when they are loaded.

Since the plugin needed to track when processes/threads start and stop, this
plugin also provides callbacks for these events.

This plugin by itself is not that useful. It is expected that you build upon it.
See `branchtrace` for example usage.

Future Ideas
------------

* Provide mmap mappings.. Maybe a callback whenever they change.
* Add ability to filter on other callbacks (ie. `after_block_exec`)
* wildcard library and process names.
* Currently hooks do not start until *trace_start* is executed. I need to
  add a mode where it starts immediately, so we can trace from when the
  program starts.
* Likewise for thread's starting.. It would be nice if we are actively tracing
  and a thread starts up, we could continue tracing the new thread. Maybe
  add a follow_threads option.
* This currently only catches new threads/processes created after the plugin
  starts. We could use OSI's `on_get_processes` whenever the plugin is loaded to
  see what's currently running.
* Use OSI's `on_get_proccesses` to ensure that we haven't missed a thread
  starting/stopping.
* ignore list of applications that we never want to trace.
* Lacks support for mips and ppc because of lack of OSI/syscalls support (I
  think).

Issues
-----

* On a new thread, the syscall return value for `sys_clone()` occasionally
  is 0.
* The process name returned by OSI (eg. get_current_process) is not the complete
  string. For example, `branchtest_multithreaded` is `branchtest_multi`. Is it
  limited to the first 16 characters?
* I've only used this against 1 re-hosted ARM firmware. It compiles for X86 and
  X64; however, I haven't verified that it works.
* Sometimes thread names are passed into on_process_start (example: "rs:main Q:Reg" from rsyslog)

Arguments
---------

Dependencies
------------

* `osi` to get memory mappings, process names, and pids.
* `syscalls2` to track when applications/threads start and stop, and to track
  when memory maps change.
