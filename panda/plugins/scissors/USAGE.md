Plugin: scissors
===========

Summary
-------

The `scissors` plugin takes a long replay and extracts out a subset of it between some starting and ending instruction count. This is very useful if you've made a replay that is very long but has some interesting portion that you want to analyze in detail.

For example, if you're doing a heavyweight analysis like taint tracking, and you know that the data you want to track isn't introduced until halfway through the replay, you can use `scissors` to snip out the latter half of the replay.

Arguments
---------

* `name`: string, defaults to "scissors". The base name of the output replay log files. E.g., using `foo` will create `foo-rr-snp` and `foo-rr-nondet.log`.
* `start`: uint64, defaults to 0. The count of the first instruction that we want included in our new replay.
* `end`: uint64, defaults to the end of the replay. The count of the last instruction that we want included in our new replay.

Dependencies
------------

None.

APIs and Callbacks
------------------

None.

Example
-------

Snipping from instruction 12345 to 8675309 into `foo_reduced`:

```sh
$PANDA_PATH/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -replay foo \
    -panda scissors:name=foo_reduced,start=12345,end=8675309
```

Bugs
----

Sometimes scissors will produce a replay file that can't be successfully replayed. As a workaround, try adjusting the start and end values and running scissors again.
