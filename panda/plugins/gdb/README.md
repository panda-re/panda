# panda-gdb

## Summary

A mixed-level approach for debugging which attempts to fit a userland-style of debugging into a hypervisor debugger by using PANDA's OSI plugin in order to allow for having an understanding of processes, memory layouts, etc. while still allowing to step through the kernel from the hypervisor.

### Usage

Currently only designed to be used with replays.

Example usage:

```
panda-system-x86_64 -os "linux-64-ubuntu:4.15.0-72-generic-noaslr-nokaslr" -replay catmaps -panda gdb:on_entry=1 -m 1G
```

Example of connecting to them:

```
$ gdb-multiarch

(gdb) target remote localhost:4444
```

Checking the registers:

```
(gdb) info reg

Here are some of the other commands that have been tested and which work:
* `c` (continue)
* `b` (set breakpoint)
* `si` (step)
* `x` (read memory)

### Dependencies

* `osi`

### Arguments

* `on_entry`: bool, optional. Defaults to true. If set to true, process will break on the entrypoint of the first process.
* `file`: String, optional. If set, process will break when the process of filename `file` starts.
