//  NOTE.  This file is a manually generated spec for the API to this plugin.
//  It is intended to be consumed by apigen.py.  Actually pycparser is what
//  consumes it.

//  Other plugin .c, .h, and cpp files SHOULD NOT include this file.
//  It looks like a real header but its not.  Those typedef voids below are a dead 
//  giveaway.  Those are there to fake out pycparser which, otherwise, would require 
//  lots of code to be pulled in to get definitions for those types, which aren't 
//  necessary for autogenerating code.  

//  Please always put the actual prototypes in a separate file, XXX_int_fns.h.
//  It is fine to #include that file.

//  Also, you CANT put and typedefs or #includes in XXX_int_fns.h as it bollocks
//  pycparser.  Unless they are ones that are easy to find like stdint.h.
//  Just the prototypes, please.
