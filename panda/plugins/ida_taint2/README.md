Plugin: ida_taint2
===========

Summary
-------
This plugin is intended to be used with the included `ida_taint2.py` script in
IDAPython. `ida_taint2.py` colorizes  and renames functions in IDA based on the
output CSV file from this plugin. This plugin produces a CSV file of process IDs
and program counter values. There should be no duplicate rows in the file.
An entry in the CSV file indicates that the instruction at the PC manipulated
tainted data. The PID is needed because the reported addresses are virtual
addresses and so one address may be in two different processes. A process ID of
0 indicates the system is in kernel mode.

The `ida_taint2.py` script reads the CSV file and highlights functions and
instructions that manipulate tainted data. Functions are highlighted green and
individual instructions are highlighted in orange. Additionally, function names
are updated with a prefix of "TAINTED_" so that it becomes possible to search
for functions that manipulated tainted data.

To use the ida_taint2.py script, open your target binary in IDA Pro, import
the script in the File -> Script Command window, click run, and when prompted
supply the path to the CSV file and the process ID you are analyzing.

Note, this script assumes IDA has loaded your binary with the correct base
address. For 32-bit Linux and Windows guests, this script should just work
(tested with IDA 7.1). The base address and/or segment may need to be adjusted
manually for DOS operating systems.

To undo the changes made by the ida_taint2.py script, an undo_ida_taint2.py
script is included. However, because IDA doesn't have a change tracking
or undo capability, this undo script makes a best attempt at removing changes
made by ida_taint2.py. If you've changed comments or colors after running
the ida_taint2.py script, the undo script may undo some of your changes.
This is unfortunately unpredictable. However, in each script, an IDA database
snapshot is made before actually modifying anything. In the worst case scenario
you may have to restore a snapshot.

If one is using IDA Pro (32-bit) with the Hex-Rays Decompiler, it is also possible to use the output of the `ida_taint2` plugin with the included `hexrays_ida_taint2.py` IDAPython plugin.  Place the `hexrays_ida_taint2.py` file in the folder that your installation of IDA Pro (32-bit) checks for plugins.  A `PANDA:  Pseudocode ida_taint2` menu item will be added to the Edit>Plugins menu.  If activated while the current window is a Hex-Rays Decompiler Pseudocode window, then the user can select an ida_taint2 output file and process within that file to use to color the pseudocode lines that tainted instructions contributed toward.
