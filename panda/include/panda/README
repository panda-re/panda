There are a few files in here that you should be a little careful with:

panda_callback_list.h
panda_plugin_mgmt.h
panda_args.h
panda_os.h
panda_api.h

This code has been carefully curated to be parseable by cffi, in order
for pypanda to be able to make use of it to import fn prototypes.
Plesae do not insert things into these file that will jeopardize that.
Here's some things that are known to cause issues.

1. #ifdefs
2. #includes
3. inline fns

Yes, I know that there are #ifndefs etc at top and bottom but these
are being tolerated.
