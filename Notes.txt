vl.c:
- ioport stuff moved to ioport.c - see that file and associated routines
- timer stuff moved to qemu-timer.c - see that file and associated routines
- main_loop_wait()
- main_loop()

cpus.c
- look at calls to cpu_signal(sig) - signals the currently running cpu
- SIG_IPI setup in qemu_tcg_init_cpu_signals() to point to cpu_signal
- iothread_requesting_mutex??
- qemu_tcg_init_vcpu()
    -> qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn()
        -> tcg_exec_all() - new main loop?
            -> tcg_cpu_exec() 
                -> setup icount stuff
                -> cpu_exec()
                -> do icount stuff
        -> qemu_tcg_wait_io_event()

- io_thread is the coordinating thread (see qemu_init_cpu_loop())
    -> called from vl.c

main-loop.c
- qemu_signal_init()
    -> SIG_IPI - for cpus
    -> SIGIO
    -> SIGALRM
    -> SIGBUS

exec.c
- memory_map_init() - looks like memory subsystem changed
- cpu_register_io_memory_fixed()?


ioport.c
- ioport_register(IORange)
    - register_ioport_read() with ioport_read_thunk()
    - register_ioport_write() with ioport_write_thunk()
    - seems like a shortcut for a port range (base, len) and sizes (1,2,4)
- register_ioport_read()
    - modifies ioport_read_table
- register_ioport_write()
    - modifies ioport_write_table
- portio_list_add()
- ioport_read_table and ioport_write_table are now here
- ioport_{read,write}{b,w,l}_thunk()??

memory.[ch]


cpu_register_physical_memory_log(start_addr, size, phys_offset, region_offset,
log_dirty) - TODO: need to fix rr_log
    - seems to be where all CPU physical memory is registered
cpu_register_io_memory(readfunc, writefund, opaque, endianness)
    - returns table address?
cpu_unregister_io_memory(table_address)
cpu_physical_memory_rw()
    - TODO also see cpu_physical_memory_map()
    - this seems to be used by devices to get a read or write (but not both)
      buffer into RAM.
    - it's used by dma-helper.c in dam_bdrv_cb() routine.  not quite sure what
      to do with it yet.

Interesting:  queued_work_first, queued_work_last in CPU env.
cpus.c:
- run_on_cpu(env, func, data)


Conditions:
- tcg_halt_cond (also env->halt_cond)
    - all envs have this as env->halt_cond
    - broadcast: qemu_kick_cpu() 
- qemu_cpu_cond
    - signal: qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn() when cpus are created
    - wait: qemu_tcg_init_vcpu() env->created == 0
- qemu_pause_cond
    - signal: qemu_wait_io_event_common() if env->stop == 1
    - signal: cpu_stop_current() if cpu_single_env
    - wait: pause_all_vcpus() while !all_vcpus_paused()
- qemu_work_cond
    - wait:  run_on_cpu() while work not done
    - broadcast:  flush_queued_work() when work completed
- qemu_io_proceeded_cond
    - wait:  qemu_tcg_wait_io_event() while iothread_requesting_mutex
    - broadcast:  qemu_mutex_lock_iothread() after qemu_mutex_lock() succeeded

Mutex:
- qemu_global_mutex
    - qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn() takes the lock before cpu creation (it's
      released temporarily whenever a wait is used)
    - qemu_mutex_lock_iothread()
        - iothread_requesting_mutex = true
        - trylock() first, if that fails:
            - qemu_cpu_kick_thread(first_cpu), then qemu_mutex_lock()
        - iotrhead_requesting_mutex = false
        - broadcast qemu_io_proceeded_cond
    - qemu_init_main_loop() - via qemu_mutex_lock_iothread()
    - os_host_main_loop_wait() - via qemu_mutex_lock_iothread() only in
      windows
    - main_loop_wait() if timeout > 0: mutex is unlocked, then select, then
      locked


Threads:
- io_thread
- tcg_cpu_thread
    - all CPUs run on this thread
- qemu_cpu_kick_thread()
    - sends SIG_IPI (SIGUSR1) to env->thread->thread (tcg_cpu_thread)
    - handled by cpu_signal()
        - if (cpu_single_env) { cpu_exit(); }
            - cpu_unlink_tb()
            - env->exit_request = 1
            - cpu_loop_exit()
        - exit_request = 1
    - causes exit from tcg_exec_all()
    - calls qemu_tcg_wait_io_event()

It looks like qemu_global_mutex synchronizes the two threads, so that CPU is
never executing code when IO thread is executing devices.  Yay!
- CPU must only be able to execute while main_loop_wait() is in the select()
  call; otherwise, it reacquires the mutex.
- This only occurs if timeout > 0, that is nonblocking = false

Memory model notes

-In addition to the notes provided in docs/memory.txt, there is more info
available here: http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Memory_API

-In vl.c inside of main(), eventually cpu_exec_init_all() is called.  This
function calls memory_map_init() and io_mem_init() to initialize the system
memory and the I/O memory.

-Later on in main(), machine->init() is called.  We can see that the init()
function pointer is actually pc_init_pci() from looking in hw/pc_piix.c at the
1.0 machine settings.  This function just calls pc_init1().

-The other functions that allocate system and PCI RAM are pc_memory_init() and
i440fx_init(), respectively.

-Inside of pc_memory_init(), the MemoryRegion 'ram' is allocated using
g_malloc().  This function is used quite often during RAM allocation, and I'm
not quite sure how it works.  But then memory_region_init_ram() is called, which
actually sets the ram_addr field by calling qemu_ram_alloc().  I'm guessing this
is the reason why the old API is still compatible with the new API, but I'm
still not quite sure how the pieces fit together, especially in terms of the
different alloc() functions.

-Here is a comment from inside pc_memory_init():
/* Allocate RAM.  We allocate it as a single memory region and use
 * aliases to address portions of it, mostly for backwards compatiblity
 * with older qemus that used qemu_ram_alloc().
 */

-Running 'info mtree' inside of the monitor allows you to see the memory map.

-As far as devices go, it seems like most (if not all) have converted to the new
memory API.  An example is in hw/e1000.c in e1000_mmio_setup(), where the new
memory API is being used.

-Overall, it's still somewhat unclear how the two memory APIs are compatible,
but the call to qemu_ram_alloc() during allocation could be responsible for
that.  There are also many other uses of ram_addr stuff in memory.c.  It's also
unclear what this means in regard to record/replay, but I will try to start
decode this by looking at the patch.

-The more I look, the more I think about it, the more I think the new memory API
is just an abstraction over the old one.  At least for now.  Consider that
exec.c still uses the old memory API.  Actually, this comment on the webpage
seems to confirm that, I guess it is just in limbo now: "Currently the memory
API is implemented on top of the old ram_addr_t API; the two APIs coexist. This
severely limits the utility of the new API. Patches are queued in..."
